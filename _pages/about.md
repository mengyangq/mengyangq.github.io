Dr. Mengyang Qiu is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Speech-Language Pathology](https://www.steu.edu/academics/aas/speech-language-pathology/index.html) at Saint Elizabeth University, beginning in Spring 2026. Before joining SEU, he was an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Psychology](https://www.trentu.ca/psychology/) at Trent University from 2023 to 2025. Dr. Qiu earned his Ph.D. in Communicative Disorders and Sciences (Cognitive Science Track) from the University at Buffalo in 2023, under the supervision of Drs. [Nichol Castro](https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/cds/people/academicfaculty.host.html/content/shared/arts-sciences/cds/faculty-profiles/academic-faculty/castro-nichol.html) and [Brendan T. Johns](https://www.mcgill.ca/psychology/brendan-t-johns). He also holds an M.S. in Computational Linguistics, an M.A. in Linguistics, and a B.A. in Psychology and Linguistics (Honors in Language and Cognition) from the University at Buffalo.

Dr. Qiu’s research includes two main lines of work. The first examines language and cognition, with an emphasis on cognitive aging. The second focuses on natural language processing, specifically grammatical error correction.

In his research on language and cognition, Dr. Qiu uses computational modeling approaches such as distributional semantics and network science, together with empirical data collection, to explore how differences in linguistic experience influence language and memory processing across aging. Core questions include how much variation in lexical performance, such as word recognition, can be explained by individual differences in language experience, and which types of test stimuli most accurately capture an individual’s linguistic knowledge. The long-term goal of this work is to delineate the natural changes that occur due to accumulated linguistic experience from actual cognitive decline in aging, thereby informing more sensitive assessment tools for neurodegenerative disorders and their early precursors.
