We propose a refined alignment-based method to assess end-to-end grammatical error correction (GEC) systems, aiming to reproduce and improve results from existing evaluation tools, such as errant, even when applied to raw text input—reflecting real-world language learners’ writing scenarios. Our approach addresses challenges arising from sentence boundary detection deviations in text preprocessing, a factor overlooked by current GEC evaluation metrics. We demonstrate its effectiveness by replicating results through a re-implementation of errant, utilizing stanza for error annotation and simulating end-to-end evaluation from raw text. Additionally, we propose a potential multilingual errant, presenting Chinese and Korean GEC results. Previously, Chinese and Korean errant were implemented independently for each language, with different annotation formats. Our approach generates consistent error annotations across languages, establishing a basis for standardized grammatical error annotation and evaluation in multilingual GEC contexts.
