# About Me
 
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Communicative Disorders and Sciences](http://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/cds.html)  at the University at Buffalo, under the supervision of Dr. [Brendan T. Johns](http://btjohns.com). I received my M.S. in Computational Linguistics, M.A. in General Linguistics and B.A. in Psychology and Linguistics (Honors Track in Language and Cognition) from the University at Buffalo.

My current research focuses on obtaining a better understanding of how the amount and content of linguistic experience influences language representation and processing in healthy cognitive aging using computational modeling and behavioral experiments. I am also interested in using natural language processing techniques and cognitive modeling to develop automated assessment procedures for detecting language and memory disorders (e.g., Specific Language Impairment, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Alzheimerâ€™s disease).

Here is my [CV](../pub/CV_Mengyang.pdf).
