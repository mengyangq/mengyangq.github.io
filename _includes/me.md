# About Me
 
I am currently an Assistant Professor (Limited Term) in the [Department of Psychology](https://www.trentu.ca/psychology/) at Trent University. I received my Ph.D. in Communicative Disorders and Sciences (Cognitive Science Track), M.S. in Computational Linguistics, M.A. in General Linguistics and B.A. in Psychology and Linguistics (Honors Track in Language and Cognition) from the University at Buffalo.

My research intersects psychology, linguistics, speech-language pathology, and computer science, employing a big data approach to explore language and cognition. Through computational modeling (e.g., distributional semantics, network science) and empirical data collection, I investigate how linguistic experience influences language representation and processing across aging.
