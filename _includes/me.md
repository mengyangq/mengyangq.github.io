# About Me
 
I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Communicative Disorders and Sciences](http://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/cds.html)  at the University at Buffalo, under the supervision of Dr. [Brendan T. Johns](http://btjohns.com) in the Computational Language and Memory Lab. I am also an M.S. candidate in [Computational Linguistics](http://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/linguistics/graduate/masters-degrees-linguistics/computational-linguistics.html). I received my M.A. in General Linguistics and B.A. in Linguistics (Honors Track in Language and Cognition) and Psychology from the University at Buffalo.

My research interests include using natural language processing techniques and computational models of memory to develop automated assessment procedures for detecting language and memory disorders (e.g., Specific Language Impairment, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimerâ€™s disease and other forms of dementia), and using behavioral experiments and cognitive modeling to delineate the natural changes that occur as a consequence of increasing amounts of experience during aging from actual cognitive decline.

Here is my [CV](../pub/CV.pdf) and [Resume](../pub/Resume.pdf).
