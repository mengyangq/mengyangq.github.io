# About Me
 
I am currently an Assistant Professor (Limited Term) in the [Department of Psychology](https://www.trentu.ca/psychology/) at Trent University. My research intersects psychology, linguistics, speech-language pathology, and computer science, employing a big data approach to explore language and cognition. Through computational modeling (e.g., distributional semantics, network science) and empirical data collection, I investigate how linguistic experience influences language representation and processing across aging.
