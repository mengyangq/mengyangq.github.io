## Memory Searching Pathway Underlying Verb Fluency
Supervisor: Brendan Johns, Ph.D.
- Verbal fluency is one of the most widely used measures of cognitive functioning, in which subjects produce as many different words as possible from a given criterion (e.g., animal category) within 1 minute.

- Compared to noun category fluency, there are fewer studies on verb fluency, even though verbs are thought to play a more prominent role in organizing mental lexicon and in describing events.

- Studying verb fluency may give us additional insights into mental lexicon organization and provide potentially different diagnostic information.

- The current study compares memory search pathway underlying verb fluency to noun (animal category) fluency using a cognitive modeling approach.
