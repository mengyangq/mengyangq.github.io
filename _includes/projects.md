### Memory Searching Pathway Underlying Verb Fluency
**Supervisor:** Brendan Johns, Ph.D.

- Verbal fluency is one of the most widely used measures of cognitive functioning, in which subjects produce as many different words as possible from a given criterion (e.g., animal category) within 1 minute.

- Compared to noun category fluency, there are fewer studies on verb fluency, even though verbs are thought to play a more prominent role in organizing mental lexicon and in describing events.

- The current study compares memory search pathway underlying verb fluency to noun (animal category) fluency using a cognitive modeling approach.

- The modeling results show that animal fluency and verb fluency have distinct memory search pathways. People dynamically use semantic (context) and syntactic (order) information to organize memory retrieval in verb fluency. 

- Verb fluency may be useful in diagnosing different clinical populations (e.g., agrammatic vs. anomic aphasia) as they may exhibit different search patterns.

### Grammatical Aspect and the Activation of Location Information
**Supervisor:** Jean-Pierre Koenig, Ph.D.

Previous studies have found that grammatical aspect (imperfective / perfective) can modulate the activation level of various participant roles (or thematic roles, e.g., agents, patients, instruments) in online sentence processing by focusing on different stages of an event. For example, Ferretti et al. (2007) found that specific event locations (locations in which all participants are located) were more activated when verbs mark situations as ongoing (imperfective aspect) than when they mark them as completed (perfect aspect). They claimed that focusing on the ongoing part of an event would naturally lead to focusing on where the event is happening. The current study extends their findings to participant locations (locations in which not all participants are located). By manipulating aspects and verbs taking different types of participant location--highly involved through the whole event vs. only in the middle vs. only at the end, it is predicted that there will be different levels of activation of location information and distinct patterns of locative phrase generation in a sentence completion task.
